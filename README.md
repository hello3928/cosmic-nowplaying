Overview
This project consists of two complementary components designed for the COSMIC desktop environment.

Panel Applet
A lightweight applet for the COSMIC panel that displays the currently playing soundtrack with the album cover.

Audio Visualiser
A separate visualiser component that reacts to the audio output and can be placed anywhere on the desktop for maximum flexibility.

*Both parts are designed to work together seamlessly, but ultimately DO NOT require eachother to be used, It is completely optional to use both.
